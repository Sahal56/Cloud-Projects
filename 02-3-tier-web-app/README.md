# **3-Tier Web Application**
- Architected & Deployed 3-Tier Web Application in AWS with Multi AZ support (3 Availability Zones).
- Utilized Load Balancing & Auto Scaling for both Web-tier & App-Tier for High Availability & Fault Tolerance.
- Secured the Infrastructure with help of Security Groups and isolated Subnets.
- Achived significant cost cut & simplified configuration management by utilizing **S3 Gateway Endpoint**, **EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint**.
- Implemented automatic infrastructure & services provising and maintenance using **Terraform (IaC)**.
- Tested manual failover of Aurora Multi-AZ database to standby instance using the AWS Management Console to ensure high availability and disaster recovery.
- Monitored the status of both Web & App Tier's Instances using **CloudWatch Alarms** to ensure optimal resource utilization and performance.


## **Architecture**

![architecture-3-tier-web-app](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc132183-8473-49b3-bcdd-1bc0a11979d5)

Overview :
- As shown above, in our 3-Tier architecture comprising of Web Tier, App Tier and Database Tier, public facing Application Load Balancer forwards serves as endpoint for clients.
- ALB forwards client's request to Web Tier Instances which are running Nginx reverse proxy that serves React.js website (Front-end)
- Front end redirects our API calls to App Tier's Internal Application Load Balancer
- Internal ALB, which iin turns forwards traffic to App Tier's Instances which is configurred to run Node.js app service (Back-end)
- Back end manipulates data in an Aurora (MySQL compatible) Multi-AZ Database and returns it to Web Tier.

Other Details :
- security :
    - configured security group to recieve incoming traffic from specified security group only. i.e web tier instances SG onnly allow HTTP traffic from ALB SG and so on
    - default NACL is utilised as of now. (will improve in future versions)
    - S3 bucket has restrictive Policy which allows acces to only specified Role following prinicple of least privilege
    - IAM Role and Instance Profile for our EC2 instance.
- Application code files, web-tier, app-tier & nginx.conf file is stored in S3 bucket. In addition to this, S3 Gatewat Endpoint is utilised to allow EC2 instances or any resources in VPC to access our bucket with less networking costs.
- For creating AMI : (used AWS Management Console)
    - Web Tier : Temporary Instance launched in Public Subnet. EC2 instance connect is used to connect Launch Instance. Installed necessary packages & code files, configuring Nginx to redirect request to Internal ALB
    - App Tier : Temporary Instance launched in Private Subnet. We have deployed **EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint (launched in June 2023)** in our Private Subnet which allows hassle free ssh access to our intsancess just by modifying security group rules
    - Region : us-east-1 | N.Virginia


> Note : In Aurora, I have not created the Read Replica due to costs. Few Credits left

---
## **Prerequisites**
- This project comprises some costs. (Used AWS Credits)
- For an estimate running of 3 hours, it should be < $3.
- We have used region : `us-east-1`, so prices of some services are on basis of that region.

- Although RDS come under free tier, but we have utilised Aurora, along with Multi-AZ. So will be charged for 2 Instances: Primary and Standby
- Some services used in this project not covered under free tier
- Region : `N.Virginia | us-east-1`

## **Explanation**

---
## **Setup In-Depth**

- Most of the services are provision using Terraform (Infrastructure as Code), while some paid service like Aurora are provision using AWS Management Console.
- We have used AWS Management Console:
    - For uploading app files to S3 bucket
    - For Creating AMI
    - For Deploying EC2 Connect Endpoint in Private Subnet
    - Temporary Security Group & Temporary In/Outbound Rules modification for testing front-end with back-end and database

#### 1. Basic Environment Setup
- Create a shell file : `set-env.sh` and replace your AWS access key & secret key
> Don't share this file anywhere : post or github
> Use Gitignore to restrict tracking this file

```sh
$ touch set-env.sh
```
```
#!/bin/bash

# Define environment variables
export TF_VAR_region=us-east-1
export TF_VAR_access_key={your access key here}
export TF_VAR_secret_key={your secret key here}
```

Make it executable
```sh
$ chmod +x set-env.sh
```

- every time you use terraform, make sure env variables are set. by running, shown as below
```sh
$ source set-env.sh
```

- Create a varibles file `terraform.tfvars` & replace with your credentials. You can modify CIDR IP Range, Regions, AZ if you want
```sh
user_name    = "your AWS username"
project_name = "your project name"

# VPC
netw_cidr            = "10.0.0.0/16"
vpc_azs              = ["us-east-1a", "us-east-1b", "us-east-1c"]
subnet_public_cidrs  = ["10.0.1.0/24", "10.0.2.0/24", "10.0.3.0/24"]
subnet_private_cidrs = ["10.0.4.0/24", "10.0.5.0/24", "10.0.6.0/24"]
subnet_db_cidrs      = ["10.0.7.0/24", "10.0.8.0/24", "10.0.9.0/24"]

s3_bucket_name = "your S3 bucket name"

```

2. Let's provision infrastruture
- we will be provisioning step by step
    1. First of all, in `main.tf` comment out every modules exept `vpc`, `route_tables`, `security_groups`

**Initialize**
```sh
$ terraform init
```

**Plan the Infrastructure**
```sh
$ terraform plan
```
**Apply the Infrastructure**
```sh
$ terraform apply
```
> Enter `yes`, if all appears okay. Alternatively use `-auto-approve` to avoid everytime entering yes

- Isolated Network with following components will be created
    - VPC
    - Subnets
    - Route Tables
    - Internet Gateway
    - Security Groups
