# **Serverless Image Thumbnail üèûÔ∏è Generator**

- It generates 128 x 128 thumbnail, whenever an image is uploaded in source bucket.
- Lambda functiion downloads image frome source bucket, process & transforms it using Python PIL package, stores/uploads output in destination bucket.
- Terraform is used to automate infrastructure provisioning & maintenance. Thus promoting Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
- Technologies used : **AWS S3, AWS Lambda, Terraform**

## **Architecture**
![arch-serverless-thumbnail-generator](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74c60f0f-6f71-4cbc-9fcd-b2182fe633ce)

#### **Configuration**
- S3 buckets :
    - source : Where the objects/files (images) will be uploaded
    - destination : Where the transformed images/thumbnail will stored (in `thumnails/` folder)
- Lamda
    - Runtime : Python 3.12
    - Layers : Pillow Library, for ap-south-1 | Mumbai : `arn:aws:lambda:ap-south-1:770693421928:layer:Klayers-p312-pillow:1` | [Check this LINK](https://github.com/keithrozario/Klayers)

**NOTE**
1. The reason we have created two buckets, is due to use of S3 event notifications as a trigger to Lambda function. As using the same bucket, it will unnessarily call Lambda function & we have to add logic to stop if thumbnail is already created for a particular image.
2. In future, we will implement
    1. thumnail generation for multiple/additional file formats like **PDF, Video files(mp4)**, etc..
    2.  **AWS SNS & SES** to send email/notify the owner/user about any failed operation of Lambda.
    3.  **Amazon Eventbridge** along with **SQS** as buffer and Dead Letter Queue for enhance scalability & Fault Tolerance.

# Steps/Workflow
> Impelementation is done as IaC

Create file : <u> terraform.tfvars </u> for declaring variables e.g. given below
```
source_bucket      = "Your Source Bucket Name"
destination_bucket = "Your Destination Bucket Name"
```

1. Setup AWS S3 Bucket
    - Create two S3 buckets

2. Setup IAM Role for Lambda
    - we have to attach policies to this role
        - AmazonS3FullAccess
        - CloudWatchLogsFullAccess

> In real production ready projects, we should only give the required permissions only (Least Privilege) on required resources only.

3. Create Lambda Function
    - we have to mention runtime with version
    - layer with arn

4. Write the Lambda Function code
    - then package into zip file

5. Add Trigger to the Lambda Function
    - source bucket for trigger
    - event: PUT
    - prefix & suffix as options

6. Test the Setup

**Terminal**
#### Initializing, terraform will download the necessary packages, libraries for setup
```shell
$ terraform init
```

#### (optional) Validate the files: to check for any syntax/configuration error in .tf files
```shell
$ terraform validate
```

#### Plan the Infrastructure. Optionally, we can save plan by passing -out=FILENAME i.e. -out=tfplan
```shell
$ terraform plan
```

#### Provision the Infrastructure. Hit **Yes** confirmation if all apears to be OK
```shell
$ terraform apply
```

7. In AWS Management console > S3, upload image/s in source bucket & see output in destination bucket
    - Also, Check CloudWatch Log Groups

Additionally, In AWS Lambda Console, we can test our Lambda (given that OBJECT is present in S3 Source bucket)
#### <u> Test Event </u>
```json
{
  "Records": [
    {
      "s3": {
        "bucket": {
          "name": "Your Source bucket Name"
        },
        "object": {
          "key": "OBJECT"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Difficulties Faced
1. Offcource Terraformm synatx!!!
   - Sol: Followed Offical documentation & yes üòé Gooogling..

2. ALthough followed as per guide, Lambda gave error, encounter the error related to arn of Pillow library (Lambda Layer)
   - Troubleshoot in Cloudwatch, that the error was related to incorrect arn.
   - I was using `arn` resource of us-east-1 (N. Virgina)
   - By googling, found Klayers repo for all AWS regions & used the suitable one of ap-south-1 (Mumbai)
   - **Learning : üëù Same resource (OS image, container image, Layers, packages) have different `arn::` as per Regions**

3. Thumbnail didn't generated as expected in few seconds.
   - Lack of patienceüòÖ, It takes time to appear. slight delay in event notification
