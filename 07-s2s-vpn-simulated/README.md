```sh
terraform init
terraform init -upgrade
terraform plan
terraform apply -auto-approve
terraform destroy
```


tried with both tunnel
in console connection was up but pings were malforming dropping or working!

Libreswan doesnâ€™t allow overlapping traffic selectors for multiple connections at the same time. i.e. same leftsubnet and rightsubnet

AL2023 X64
dnf update
dnf install libreswan
[root@ip-172-31-37-172 ec2-user]# ipsec --version
Libreswan 4.12


frr in ubuntu use snap package


NOTE:
Libreswan versions before 4.5 do not support keyexchange=ikev2 keyword.

Libreswan negotiates IKEv1 by default.

To use IKEv2 with Libreswan, you need a recent version and a different config style

make sure after s2s vpn
add static routes in vpn 192.168.0.0/16 in VPN Gateway in AWS VPC (10.0.0.0/16)

Disable Src/Dest Check StrongSwan

Route Tables:
On prem : 10.0.0.0/16 to StrongSwan-Instance ID i-dqdxax
AWS : 192.168.0.0/16 to VPN Gateway Attachment

1. Test Connectivity
2. Provision : After Strong Connection confirmation
  - 4 EC2
  - 1 RDS

Idea
as i dont have public IP from Home Router


I have to use simulated one


We will restrict AZ to use only one for less networking Costs : `ap-south-1a`

---

AWS
VPC : `10.0.0.0/16`
Public Subnet : `10.0.0.0/24`
Private Subnet : `10.0.1.0/24`

On Premises (Simulated):
VPC : `192.168.0.0/16`
Public Subnet : `192.168.0.0/24`
Private Subnet : `192.168.1.0/24`


what can i do instead of pinging
i can setup Web App in aws vpc and 
use from on-prem vpc

strongSwan instance:

- Assign an Elastic IP (EIP)
- Stop Change Source/Destination check

## **Implementation Workflow**

Steps:
1. Provision Infrastructure (VPCs) first
2. Provision/Established S2S Connection
3. Provision EC2 Instance to Test and Use


for Step 1
- provision infrastructure
- provision ensure secuity groups & NACLs

for Step 2
- we nee one Instance with Public IP in on-prem vpc in which will installed strong swan.
- we have to configure strongswan (automate using user data script)
- provision customer gateway, vpn gateway
- established s2s connection as usual

for Step 3:
- in on-prem vpc, provision a new instance (private ip prefered)
- im aws vpc, provision a new instance (private ip prefered)
- try pinging between them

cant ping allow icmp

in s2s connection you can't modify routing: static <-> dynamic (BGP). so make sure you check first what you need

use static here only
